I focus on make the more acurate and useful assets tree, i think it's the main feature and the center of the application.

If I had more time there's some things I would improve, like:

- [ ] Better organization of the sensor part, create components and make the style in other files.
- [ ] Add some kind of loading to the change of company, this can help to improve the sensation of speed.
- [ ] Add support for other languages
- [ ] Custom filtering, by type of sensor and state of the sensor.
- [ ] Get some data of the sensors and create some charts


I didn't use librarys, except for the react. But in a real application, a component and a style library would be very useful.
